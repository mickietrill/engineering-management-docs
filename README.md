# Engineering Management Documentation

This repository contains a growing set of practical documents, templates, and playbooks
that I use in my work as an Engineering Manager and engineering leader.

The goal of this documentation is not theory, but **repeatable, real-world practices**
that help teams execute better, communicate clearly, and make sound decisions.

This is a living system and evolves incrementally as new documents are added.


## How to Use This Repository
- Each document is designed to be **used in practice**, not just read
- Documents are grouped by responsibility and scope
- The README is updated **only when a new document is added**, to keep structure honest and maintainable

## Foundations
Core principles that define how teams communicate and collaborate.
These documents act as organizational-level agreements.

- **[Communication Guidelines](foundations/communication-guidelines.md)**  
  Rules and principles for written and verbal communication, conflict handling, and escalation.

## Execution
Practical tools for running day-to-day work, planning, and delivery.
- **[Meeting Templates](execution/meeting-templates.md)**  
  Structured templates for common meetings (planning, syncs, retrospectives, etc.).
- **[Task Templates](execution/task-templates.md)**  
  Standardized task formats to improve clarity, ownership, and execution.

## Architecture & API Standards
Standards and guidelines that define technical contracts and long-term system quality.

- **[REST API Design Standards](engineering/rest-api-design-standards.md)**  
  Organization-wide principles and rules for designing, evolving, and maintaining REST APIs, including resource modeling, error handling, versioning, pagination, and governance.

- **[Internal Repository README Standards](engineering/internal-repository-readme-standards.md)**  
  Organization-wide standard for structuring internal repository READMEs, including mandatory sections, microservices requirements, operational documentation, review checklist, and a reusable README template.  


## Document Principles
All documents in this repository follow these principles:
- **Actionable** — designed to be used immediately
- **Explicit** — expectations and responsibilities are clearly stated
- **Experience-driven** — based on real situations and trade-offs
- **Iterative** — documents evolve as practices improve

## Scope and Intent
This repository reflects my personal approach to:
- Engineering Management
- Team leadership
- Execution and delivery
- Communication and collaboration

It is intentionally opinionated and based on practical experience rather than abstract frameworks.

## Status
This documentation is actively maintained.
New documents are added incrementally, and the structure evolves alongside them.
